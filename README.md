## 🏆 The challenge
The challenge was to build a React application with a form asking the user's name, e-mail, telephone number, cpf, and countries and cities of interest. All fields should be required. The countries and cities field should allow multiple selection and also make a GET from an Amazon's API.

Users should be able to:

- Fill all fields with the asked information
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- Select countries and cities from an external info source

<br>

## 🎯 Learning goals

Learn how to make a GET request from an API in a React interface and how to build a multiple select component with React.

<br>

## 🚀 Technologies

This project was built using following technologies:

- React
- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS
- React-select
- Axios
- Radix
- Figma
- GIT
- Vite
- Node

<br>

## 💻 Project

The main challenge on this project was to build the multi select for countries and cities and populate it with an API information. I build the project layout design on Figma based on Airbnb design. I used Axios to get the API information and react-select to create the component to show the information for the user.
