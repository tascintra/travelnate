## 🏆 The challenge
The challenge was to build an intro section of a web page for a company that offers better productivity for teams that work remotely. The section has a top menu with 6 options and 2 of them are drop down menus with more options inside them and the greatest challenge was to build interaction between them.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- Have interation with the web page when they click on a drop down menu

<br>

## 🎯 Learning goals

Improve my skills with JavaScript DOM and building interface interactions.

<br>

## 🚀 Technologies

This project was built using following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- GIT

<br>

## 💻 Project

![](.github/intro-section-demo.gif)

The main challenge on this project was to build the solution to keep only one drop down menu opened at once. So I had to create the alternance feature with JavaScript. And I also created a function to identify and close the drop down menu when the user clicks outsite of them. I build the responsiveness using media queries and the main content has multiple breakpoints creating the optimal layout for small screens and big screens.

## ✔️ I learned

How to build JavaScript drop down menu interations and mobile menu interations and improved my DOM and positioning skills.

<br>

## 👨‍💻 Continued development

Now for the next project I'll refactor the [loopstudios](https://github.com/tascintra/loopstudios) project that I made some time ago and wasn't able to finish the challenge. The loopstudios project is a landing page that has some interactions with mobile menu and is challenging to make the proposed positioning in the page.
